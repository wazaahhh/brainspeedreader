A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested the possibility to reconstruct visual experience from brain measurements \cite{kay2008identifying,naselaris2009bayesian,nishimoto2011reconstructing}. These studies typically 
involve in depth studies of the brain circuitry (, with high spatial and temporal resolution equipment), such as {\bf [say about the most common approaches]}. Focus on detailed brain circuitry with cutting-edge equipment comes at the cost of scalable and reproducible identification of human activity in naturalistic environments. Here, we invert the trade-off and focus our effort on decoding {\bf [how?]} human activity from low quality signal delivered by consumer-grade EEG headsets. Although the proposed {\it DIY} approach provides limited direct insights on the detailed functioning of the brain, it may deliver enough informative signal to successful identify human activities involving cognitive activity at large scale and in naturalistic environments.
