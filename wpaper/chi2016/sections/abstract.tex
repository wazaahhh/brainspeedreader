Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is widely used for speed reading. However, a lack of seamless control over RSVP speed has remained a bottleneck in the broader adoption of this technology. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) present an opportunity for the quick control of a computer device ``directly from the mind", as meaningful electroencephalography (EEG) signal is usually transmitted in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. In this study, we leverage EEG for the purpose of seamlessly controlling speed reading. We use a lightweight bio-feedback mechanism, in which EEG signals are used to set the speed of an RSVP speed-reading interface. We evaluate how participants manage to control the speed reader, and assess the  comfort, understanding and speed gains provided by the {\it Brainspeedr}.
